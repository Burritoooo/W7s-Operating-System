# My Awesome OS

My Awesome OS is an open-source operating system designed to be fast, lightweight, and easy to use. It is written in C and Assembly and aims to provide a reliable and secure environment for both personal and professional use.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive command-line interface
- Multi-tasking and multi-user support
- File system with support for multiple file formats
- Networking stack with support for TCP/IP and UDP protocols
- Support for various hardware devices, such as keyboards, mice, and displays

## Getting Started

To build and run My Awesome OS, you'll need to have a few tools installed on your system. These include:

- A GNU-compatible C compiler
- A NASM-compatible assembler
- A disk image creation tool (such as `dd` on Linux)

Once you have these tools installed, you can clone the repository and build the OS using the following commands:

$ git clone https://github.com/username/my-awesome-os.git
$ cd my-awesome-os
$ make

vbnet
Copy code

This will compile the source code and generate a bootable disk image called `my-awesome-os.img`. You can then run the OS in a virtual machine or on real hardware by writing the disk image to a USB drive or CD-ROM.
